# Minimal PHP Ticketing System

This is a simple ticketing system. It supports basic functionality such as user authentication, ticket creation, and department.

## ðŸ§° Requirements

Make sure the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- **PHP** (>= 7.4 recommended)
- **MySQL** or **MariaDB**
- **Redis** server
- **PHP Redis client** (e.g., `php-redis` extension)

## ðŸš€ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone project url
   ```

# Use the included SQL file (db/schema.sql) to create the required tables:

A default admin user is created with the following credentials:

Email: admin@gmail.com

Password: 12345678

# Set Up Configuration

Open the file helpers/database.php

Update the database and Redis configuration with your credentials:

```
    $host = '127.0.0.1';
    $db = 'ticketing';
    $user = 'root';
    $pass = '';

    $redis_host = '127.0.0.1';
    $redis_port = 6379;
```

# Create uploads/ Folder

# If you're using XAMPP:

# If you're using Nginx:

Set the document root to the main folder

Ensure PHP is configured with php-fpm

Restart Nginx after setup
